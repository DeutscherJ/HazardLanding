Great clonk.

The Quake-Bot is similar to the hazard bot. He fires his weapon on Throw, and can fire the alternate firemode on Dig, if supported by the weapon.

Like the hazard the Quake-Bot is able to perform a backflip and aim with a weapon.

In addition he can change his appearence over the context-menu.
